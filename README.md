# Get It.

### Read it. See it. Get it.

**The study companion that turns a PDF into a measurable mastery map. Built around the document, not in place of it.**

## The problem

The student already has the PDF. They don't need another summary. They need to see the parts a textbook refuses to draw, and they need a way to prove to themselves that they have understood. Concept by concept, not page by page.

Today's tools measure surface area, not depth. Flashcard ratings measure recall in the moment. Mind maps measure how much you drew. Summaries measure how patient the AI was. None of them answer the only question that matters on exam day:

> *Would I survive a question I have not seen before?*

Get It. is the layer that answers it.

## How it works

Drop a PDF. Three things start at once.

1. **The page tags itself.** A concept-detection agent walks every page and plants inline tag pills on the words that benefit from a picture. Each tag carries a renderer choice: 3D scene, 2D animation, formula walkthrough, plotted graph, or cited source.
2. **The right pane fills in.** Up to four visualizations render in parallel as the document is read. Three.js for anatomy and molecules, Canvas for physics and chemistry animations, KaTeX-clean formulas, a plot engine for functions and distributions, authoritative quotes for legal articles and named papers. When a sandbox crashes, the agent reads its own error and re-emits a fix. The student sees "repairing" instead of red text.
3. **A knowledge graph builds itself.** Six to twenty-five concept nodes, typed edges, sized by mastery, coloured by progress, clickable for the four-axis breakdown plus the evaluator's note.

Then the loop closes. Four study tools feed one journal.

| Tool | What it measures |
|---|---|
| 💬 **Chat** | Recall references and paraphrases. Multi-turn, multi-thread, scoped to one document. |
| 🎴 **Flashcards** | Open-recall under self-grade. Again / Hard / Good / Easy on every card. |
| ✅ **Quizzes** | Forced-choice discrimination. One correct answer, three plausible distractors. |
| 💡 **Feynman** | The agent plays a curious eight-year-old. *You* teach. The strongest comprehension signal. |

After every completed session the **evaluator** agent reads the journal end-to-end and updates four scores per concept node on the knowledge graph: **memory, comprehension, structure, application**. Each scored 0 to 100. Each monotone non-decreasing by a runtime clamp. The student can only progress, never regress.

The four numbers are the difference between a study app and a measurement instrument.

## Bring your own ChatGPT

The AI side of Get It. has no business model layered on top.

You sign in once with the ChatGPT account you already pay for (or an OpenAI API key) through the official Codex CLI. Every agent inside the app runs against your own tier. There is no Get It. server, no shared key pool, no per-message metering, no "AI credits" wallet, no second subscription, and no plan to ever ship one.

- **You pay for AI once.** ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, or Edu covers everything Get It. does.
- **Plus is the practical floor.** The free tier signs in but its Codex allowance is intentionally small. Plus and above give comfortable session headroom in the same flow.
- **Your data stays yours.** No backend, no upload step, no analytics. The work-context journal is a single JSON file on your disk, downloadable in one click from the right-pane menu.
- **Rate limits are OpenAI's.** When you hit one, the app shows a countdown banner and resumes the background work itself once the window clears.

Other AI study apps wrap a marked-up subscription around a model API the vendor holds. Get It. wraps a study workflow around the access you already have.

## Install

Get It. is a desktop app. Download the installer for your machine, double-click, sign in with the ChatGPT account you already use. Nothing else to buy.

| Platform | Installer |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon, M1 / M2 / M3 / M4) | `Get It-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `Get It-<version>.dmg` |
| Windows 10 / 11 (x64) | `Get It Setup <version>.exe` |
| Linux (x64) | `Get It-<version>.AppImage` |

Every release ships on the **[Releases](https://github.com/beltromatti/get-it/releases)** page. The app checks for a newer build on every launch and offers a one-click update inside its own window.

### First launch

The setup wizard verifies the bundled Codex CLI, walks the OAuth sign-in, and refuses to open the main window until both gates are green. Then drop a PDF, or open one of the five bundled samples (anatomy, classical mechanics, Italian constitution, calculus, organic chemistry). Tags, chats, flashcard decks, quizzes, Feynman sessions, and the knowledge graph all stay on your computer.

### Gatekeeper and SmartScreen

Builds are **ad-hoc code-signed**, not notarized. A paid Apple Developer ID is a funding decision deferred for now; ad-hoc is the free path that still satisfies the Apple Silicon kernel's mandatory-signature requirement (without it M-series Macs report the bundle as "damaged" and refuse to open it at all).

The first launch on macOS still asks you to confirm the developer:

- **System Settings.** Double-click `Get It.app` → dismiss the "unidentified developer" warning → open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the "Get It.app was blocked" row, and click **Open Anyway**. macOS Sequoia (15) and macOS 26 removed the older right-click → Open shortcut, so this is the canonical path.
- **CLI.** `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Get It.app"` strips the download-quarantine flag in one shot.

Windows shows a SmartScreen warning the first time. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.

### Storage

Everything lives under one OS-native directory.

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/get-it/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\get-it\` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/get-it/` |

Layout: one folder per document at `docs/<docId>/` (source PDF, extracted text cache, tags, work context, knowledge graph), a `docs.json` index at the root, a `codex-scratch/` working dir, and `logs/`. Deleting a doc from the Library wipes the whole folder.

## Hack on it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beltromatti/get-it.git
cd get-it
npm install
npm run dev    # builds the Next.js standalone bundle and opens it in Electron
```

`npm run dev` exercises the full path: setup wizard, embedded server, IPC bridge. Re-run after edits.

For browser-side hot reload:

```bash
npm run browser:dev    # http://localhost:3000
```

(The Electron-internal HMR loop has a known Next 16.2.6 + Turbopack + Chromium 130 hydration glitch, so browser dev or rebuild-and-test is the cleaner inner loop.)

Local desktop builds, one or all targets:

```bash
npm run build && npm run electron:prepare

node scripts/build-electron.mjs --target=mac-arm64   # or mac-x64 / win-x64 / --all
```

Artefacts land in `dist-electron/`. Cross-arch builds pull the matching Codex platform package from npm on the fly, so you do not need an Intel Mac or a Windows VM to build for them.

Releases are tag-driven. Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag to `main` and `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds every target on a native runner, attaches the `.dmg` / `.exe` / `.AppImage` to a GitHub Release, and pins the version into Info.plist and NSIS metadata from the tag itself.

Nine prompts behind one auth path, nine schemas behind one shared SDK wrapper. The full design rationale, the four-axis rubric, the per-doc evaluator queue, the LLM-code sandbox, and the desktop-packaging layer are in [`technical-writeup.md`](technical-writeup.md), also rendered as [PDF](technical-writeup.pdf).

## The team

Built in 24 hours at **GDG AI Hack 2026, Milan**, for the **Braynr** challenge. The hackathon submission lived at commit `277ec43`. Everything past that commit is post-hackathon polish: desktop packaging, the persistent Library, the first-launch setup wizard, the quizzes tool, the in-app auto-update flow, the server-side jobs runner. The product is the same. Only the way it gets onto a student's laptop has changed.
