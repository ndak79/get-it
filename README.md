# Braynr Visualizer

> Read with a brain on your shoulder.

Drop in any text-tagged PDF. Braynr's agent reads it page by page, picks the
concepts that benefit from a visual aid, and renders them right next to
the text — 3D anatomy / molecules, animated 2D simulations, formula
walkthroughs with KaTeX, plotted graphs, or live source citations.

The agent is the locally-installed [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
(`codex exec`), invoked through the official `@openai/codex-sdk` with a
strict `outputSchema` per call so every response is typed JSON.

---

## Run it

Pre-requisites:
- Node 20+
- An authenticated `codex` CLI (`codex login`) — the demo uses your local
  ChatGPT or API account.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # tweak NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTO_GENERATE_VIZ if needed
npm run generate-pdfs   # one-time: build the 5 sample PDFs into public/pdfs
npm run dev             # http://localhost:3000
```

### Auto vs manual generation

`NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTO_GENERATE_VIZ` controls whether the visualizer eagerly
generates a spec for every detected tag, or waits for a click:

- **unset / `true`** — production behavior: every tag fires its viz
  generation in parallel (capped at 4 concurrent), the user sees the
  right pane fill in by itself.
- **`false`** — dev behavior: tags appear but no codex token is spent
  until the user clicks a tag. A small "manual mode" chip shows up in
  the viewer header. Use this when iterating on the UI.

### Auto-fix loop on visualizer crashes

The Three.js / Canvas code that codex emits can occasionally fail to
compile or run (a stray template-literal backtick, a missing return,
calling a stub method). When that happens the visualizer captures the
error, hands the broken `setup_code` plus the runtime message straight
back to codex, and asks for a fix. We do this up to
`NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_VIZ_GEN_RETRIES` additional times (default 3, total of
4 attempts).

The repair call goes to the same `/api/generate-viz` endpoint with an
extra `previousAttempt: { spec, runtimeError }` body, which prepends a
"diagnose and fix" preamble to the system prompt and bumps reasoning
effort one notch. The user sees the loader come back with a "repairing —
attempt N of M" sub-line; if the budget runs out, the visualizer surfaces
the final error.

### Tab-scoped persistence

Viewer state is mirrored to `sessionStorage` so it survives F5 / Next.js
Fast-Refresh / browser back-forward, and dies cleanly when the tab
closes. Specifically:

- detected tags + their positions
- generated viz specs (instantly re-rendered after reload)
- which pages have already been analyzed (no re-detection)
- the active tag selection (right pane stays on the same viz)

Tags whose generation was *in flight* when the page reloaded are
re-enqueued on mount, so the work just keeps going. A "restored" chip
in the header confirms a cache hit; a "reset" button next to the
progress chips wipes the cache and re-detects from scratch.

Implementation: [`lib/persistence.ts`](lib/persistence.ts) wraps the
`sessionStorage` calls, [`app/viewer/[docId]/viewer-client.tsx`]
hydrates on mount via `useState` lazy initializers, debounce-saves on
every state change, and force-flushes synchronously on `pagehide` /
`visibilitychange:hidden` so nothing is lost to the debounce window.

Open the home page, drop a PDF (or click any of the 5 sample documents),
and watch tags appear inline as the agent reads each page. Tags pulse
while the visualization is being prepared, then become clickable.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐   POST /api/upload     ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Browser     │ ─────────────────────► │  Server                     │
│              │                        │   • saves PDF to /tmp       │
│              │                        │   • pdfjs-dist extracts     │
│              │ ◄─ {docId, pages…} ─── │     text + per-glyph bboxes │
└──────────────┘                        └─────────────────────────────┘
                                                  │
   page renders, then                  per-page   ▼  per-tag
   POST /api/analyze-pdf  ◄──── codex (low effort, JSON schema)
   POST /api/generate-viz ◄──── codex (low effort, +web_search for legal)
```

Detection is parallel (3 pages at a time). Visualization generation is
parallel (4 tags at a time). The first ready tag is auto-selected so the
right pane is never empty.

## The five render modes

| type        | renderer                          | example pick                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `3d`        | Three.js scene with auto-orbit    | heart, methane, brain               |
| `2d-anim`   | Canvas2D, frame-by-frame draw     | inclined plane, blood flow, valves  |
| `formula`   | KaTeX, headline + step derivation | F=ma, projectile equations          |
| `graph`     | Custom Canvas chart               | range vs angle, bell curve          |
| `2d-text`   | Markdown + cited sources          | Articolo 11, court rulings          |

## Generating new sample PDFs

`scripts/generate-sample-pdfs.ts` is a single-file pdfkit generator. Add a
new entry to the `docs` array and run `npm run generate-pdfs`.

## Smoke testing

```bash
npm run smoke         # one PDF, one tag click, screenshot
npm run smoke-all     # all 5 PDFs, multiple tag types, screenshots → scripts/smoke-out/
```

Both rely on a running dev server at the URL in `BASE_URL` (default
`http://localhost:3457`).

## Notes & limits

- The PDF must already have a text layer. We do not OCR.
- Visualization code from the LLM runs client-side in a `new Function(...)`
  body wrapped by an IIFE that shadows `THREE`, `ctx`, etc. We block the
  obvious globals (`document`, `window`, `fetch`, `eval`, …) but this is a
  demo sandbox, not a hard security boundary.
- Generation latency: detection ~10–20s/page (low effort), code generation
  ~30–60s for 3D / 2D-anim, ~10–15s for formula / graph / text. Plan
  accordingly when picking PDFs.
